excerpt: Why I created a Workout log app.

In 2016 I made a life-changing choice, I decided it was time to stop wasting time and energy on short term diets for that summer body.

I wanted to find a way of life, a system to stop thinking that being muscular is some level to unlock or a goal to achieve.

After a ton of research and trial and error, I reached my target weight, also keeping a decent amount of muscle.

In the second half of 2016, I focused on building muscle without gaining fat. For that, I used myfitnesspal to count calories and a clunky app to log my workouts.

4 years later, I’m still keeping the weight off.

I like what I see when I look at myself in the mirror.

That’s why I want to make this journey easier for each person who wants to start being healthy, fit, and strong.

I know for a fact that having a nice muscular body is not that easy, but it's simple.

That’s where Iron Pal comes in. I’m working on a workout log to make your journey easier by being able to track the right amount of rest time between exercises and to plan the progressive overload of weights lifted.
