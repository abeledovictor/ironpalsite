excerpt: Use Grease the Groove technique to increase your pull-ups
---

The most common approach to increase the number of reps of a given exercise is to perform some sets of it in a short period of time (AKA going to the gym for ~1 hour).

This way of increasing reps has some perks for pull-ups:
- If you try to reach muscular failure each time you perform pullups, it can cause injuries in muscles or ligaments
- It can cause muscular fatigue
- Performing an exercise with bad technique can lead to injuries

### How to get better at it
We will use the **Grease The Groove** approach to increase pullups.

With Grease the groove you are consistently practicing a physical exercise. The more you practice, the more of a pathway forms between your muscles and your nervous system.

Instead of practicing the exercise in a short period of time, you are doing 1 or two series with low reps spread across the day.

With Grease the groove you _are_:
- Focusing on quality over quantity
- Putting more volume in reps than if you just exercised at the gym
- It complements your fitness routine instead of interfering it


### Example of Greasing the groove
Let's say that you can do 6 pull-ups with good technique in a row, and you want to increase the number of them.

You should pick a number of reps that is _challenging_ but that doesn't compromise your pull-up form. So you're doing 3 pullups on each Grease the Groove training session, spread across the day.

Your schedule for that day could be:
- 6:00 am wake up
- 6:10 am perform 3 pullups
- 6:30 am breakfast
- 7:00 am perform 3 pullups
- 8:00 am go to work
- 5:00 pm come back home
- 5:10 pm 3 more pullups
- 6:00 pm another 3
- 8:00 pm 3 reps
- 10:00 pm last 3 before going to bed

That day you'd have performed 18 reps total. You can repeat it from Monday to Saturday. 108 pullups in one week!

After 2 weeks of greasing the groove, you can test your max reps. If you now can do 7 of them, you can start performing 4 pullups in every set.
