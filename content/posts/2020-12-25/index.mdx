excerpt: Is it possible to bulk up and lose weight simultaneously?

Building muscle and losing weight are not mutually exclusive. But after wasting years failing to achieve a decent physique, I came up with a conclusion:
**It's better to pick one of the two and commit to it.**

### Gaining muscle vs. losing fat
We are all in this to get a better and healthier body.

All in all, we all want to be thin and to be muscular at the same time!

So, if you want to achieve a fit body, I think it's a better approach to divide your main goal of having a healthier body into two different steps:
1. First, get slim
2. Build some mass & gain more muscle and less fat

#### BUT WHY?
In order to build muscle, you need to bulk up. If you are slim already, you'll be able to appreciate your muscle-building progress more, and, your body will respond better to the training because your metabolism is higher.

### How lean should you get to raise your metabolism
I think the best is to reach between 10 and 12 percent (%) of bodyfat before jumping to step No.2 ( building muscle )


### What to eat on each step?
You should always prefer natural food over processed meals. Think of jacket potato and olive oil on top _versus_ a bag of potato chips.
